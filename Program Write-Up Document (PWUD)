Assignment: A1 - Object Oriented Battle Creatures! 

 

1. Explanation 

Objective: Provide a clear and concise overview of your program. Explain the purpose of the class and its role within the context of the assignment. Describe how the class and its methods align with object-oriented programming principles. 

Explanation:

Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est labor 

2. UML Diagram of the Creature Class 

Objective: Provide a visual representation of your class structure using a UML diagram. This helps in understanding the organization of the class and its relationships. 

Details: 

Include the class name, attributes, methods, and their access levels (e.g., public, private). 

Use UML notation to show the relationships between attributes and methods. 

Tools like PlantUML, Lucidchart, or even hand-drawn diagrams (scanned or photographed) are acceptable.

3. Focused Discussion on Key Components of the Program 

Objective: Provide an in-depth analysis of the core components of your program. 

Details: 

Class Design: Explain the rationale behind the design of the class, including how it models a battle creature and interacts with other classes or components. 

Attributes: Discuss the chosen attributes, their data types, and how they are used within the class. 

Methods: Describe each method's purpose, how it manipulates the class’s attributes, and how it supports the overall functionality. 

Encapsulation: Explain how you have used encapsulation to protect and manage the class’s data.

4. Screenshots Demonstrating the Test Program 

Objective: Provide visual proof that your test program works as intended. 

Details: 

Include screenshots showing the creation of an instance of your class and the execution of its methods. 

Make sure the screenshots clearly display the program's output and any interactions with the class. 

At least two screenshots should be provided: one showing the initial state of the creature and another showing the results after invoking some methods.

5. Creature Description Image 

Objective: Include a visual representation of your creature based on its description. 

Details: 

Create or obtain an image that depicts the creature as described in the description attribute. 

You can use graphic design tools, drawing software, or AI tools like ChatGPT to generate this image. 

Ensure the image is clear and aligns with the attributes and description provided.

7. Complete Java Code (Appendix) 

Objective: Provide the full Java code for your class. 

Details: 

Include the complete and well-commented code of your class. 

Ensure the code is formatted correctly and adheres to Java coding standards. 

Place the code in the appendix section of your document. 

Code: 

// Defines the class `Xavior`, representing a creature 
class Xavior {    
    
    // Attributes of the creature  
    String Nickname = "Xav";  // Stores the creature's nickname, default is "Xav" 
    String Type = "wind";  // Stores the type of the creature, default is "wind" 
    String Description = "A powerful wind Dragon."; // Stores the description of the creature 
    int Level = 1;   // Initial level of the creature, set to 1 
    // Method to level up the creature 
    void Levelup() { 
        Level += 1; // Increases the creature's level by 1 
    } 
    // Getter method for the creature's current level 
    int getLevel() { 
        return Level; // Returns the current level of the creature 
    }  
    // Getter method for the creature's nickname 
    String getNick() { 
        return Nickname; // Returns the current nickname of the creature 
    } 
    // Setter method to update the creature's nickname  
    void setNick(String Nick) { 
        Nickname = Nick; // Sets the nickname to a new value 
    } 
    // Getter method for the creature's type 
    String getType() { 
        return Type; // Returns the type of the creature 
    } 
    // Getter method for the creature's description 
    String getDescription() { 
        return Description; // Returns the description of the creature 
    } 
} 

// Defines the `Main` class, which contains the entry point of the program 
public class Main{ 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create a new instance of the Xavior class, representing a creature 
    
    Xavior Creature = new Xavior(); 
    
    // Display the initial state of the creature 
    System.out.println("Initial state of BattleCreature:"); 
    System.out.println("Nickname: " + Creature.getNick());// Retrieve and display the creature's nickname 
    System.out.println("Type: " + Creature.Type); // Display the type of the creature 
    System.out.println("Level: " + Creature.getLevel());// Retrieve and display the creature's 
                                                        // current level
    System.out.println("Description: " + Creature.getDescription());// Retrieve and display the 
                                                                    // creature's description 
    // Call the Levelup method to increase the creature's level
    Creature.Levelup(); // Increment the creature's level by 1
    // Call the setNick method to update the creature's nickname
    Creature.setNick("Xeno"); // Change the nickname from "Xav" to "Xeno" 
    // Display the updated state of the creature after leveling up and nickname change
    System.out.println("After Calling Levelup and SatNick Methods:");
    System.out.println("Nickname: " + Creature.getNick()); // Retrieve and display the new nickname
    System.out.println("Type: " + Creature.Type); // Display the type of the creature 
    System.out.println("Level: " + Creature.getLevel()); // Retrieve and display the updated level 
    System.out.println("Description: " + Creature.getDescription());// Retrieve and display the 
                                                                    // creature's description
        }
